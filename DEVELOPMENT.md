# Local development

This repo is a Home Assistant custom integration. Python changes only take effect after HA restarts. Day-to-day git is the **`dev`** branch; a PR to `master` is a release ([`docs/GIT.md`](docs/GIT.md), [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md)).

The sandbox is configured in YAML under `dev/config/`:

- `packages/` — extra virtual lights per area ([hass-virtual](https://github.com/twrecked/hass-virtual), old-style YAML)
- `scenes.yaml` — gitignored native scenes for this sandbox (HA writes it back from the UI)
- `area_map.yaml` — area assignment (HA has no YAML for this; applied to the registries after first boot)

Onboarding created the areas **Stue**, **Kjøkken**, and **Soverom**.

## Start

Install hass-virtual into the sandbox (once):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch v0.9.3 https://github.com/twrecked/hass-virtual.git /tmp/hass-virtual
mkdir -p dev/config/custom_components
cp -R /tmp/hass-virtual/custom_components/virtual dev/config/custom_components/virtual
```

```bash
test -f dev/config/scenes.yaml || echo '[]' > dev/config/scenes.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8123 and finish onboarding (once). Then assign lights and scenes to areas:

```bash
docker compose stop
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint python3 homeassistant /config/apply_area_map.py
docker compose start
```

After that:

1. **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Scene Studio** (once; the form is empty)
2. Open **Scene Studio** in the sidebar
3. **Add** a scene (area + native dag/kveld/natt scenes)
4. Activate the generated `scene.*` from **Developer tools → States**

Logs: `dev/config/home-assistant.log` or `docker compose logs -f`.

## After code changes

HA does not hot-reload custom component Python. Restart, then test again:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

YAML in `dev/config/` can usually be reloaded from **Developer tools → YAML**. Translation JSON under `custom_components/` still needs a restart. After adding new lights, re-run `apply_area_map.py` with HA stopped.

## Unit tests

Python:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install pytest homeassistant
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q
```

Frontend (no Home Assistant, no browser). CI runs the same command:

```bash
node --test tests/frontend/*.test.mjs
```

That suite covers wheel grouping (`tests/frontend/pin_groups.test.mjs`), light-tile color groups and modifier selection (`tests/frontend/light_tile_select.test.mjs`), and the simple-scene card dot (`tests/frontend/card_mesh.test.mjs`). Scene icon round-trip is in `tests/test_store_v4.py`. Layout and pointer behavior of the panel are checked in the sandbox with Chrome DevTools MCP. Do not add Playwright. The panel sits in Home Assistant’s shadow DOM behind login; a browser runner would need Docker and sandbox credentials and would not replace these rule tests. See [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) (“Frontend checks are node:test plus the sandbox, not Playwright”).

CI runs the same suite (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

Config, onboarding, and your test entities persist in `dev/config/` (runtime files are gitignored).

## Agent REST token (optional)

To let Cursor agents call the sandbox REST API, create a long-lived token in the sandbox UI (Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens), copy `dev/config/secrets.yaml.example` to `dev/config/secrets.yaml`, and set `cursor_ha_token`. See [`.cursor/skills/home-assistant-api/SKILL.md`](.cursor/skills/home-assistant-api/SKILL.md).

## Agent UI login (optional)

Same `secrets.yaml` holds `sandbox_ha_username` and `sandbox_ha_password` for Chrome DevTools MCP against `http://127.0.0.1:8123/scene_studio`. If those keys are missing, agents should ask. Do not commit `secrets.yaml`.
