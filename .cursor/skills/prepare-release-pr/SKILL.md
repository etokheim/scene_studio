  Prepare a Circadian Scenes release PR from dev to master: sync
  translations, rewrite CHANGELOG Unreleased from the diff since the last
  release, then open the PR. Merging that PR runs the GitHub release workflow.
  Use when the user asks to release, ship, publish to HACS, cut a version, tag,
  or open a PR to master.

# Prepare a release PR (`dev` → `master`)

Do **not** bump `manifest.json`, reset `PANEL_ASSET_REV`, move Unreleased into
a version heading, push a `v*` tag, or run `gh release create`. Merging the PR
to `master` does that (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

Work from **`dev`**. Feature branches merge to `dev` first.

## 0. Branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev
git merge origin/master --no-edit
```

If `origin/dev` does not exist: `git checkout -b dev origin/master && git push -u origin dev`.

Stop if `dev` is not what should ship (unrelated WIP, failing tests). Merge or
park that work before continuing.

## 1. Translations

English is the only file kept current during development. This is the single
pass for **nb / nn / de / es**. How-to: [panel-translations](../panel-translations/SKILL.md).

1. Diff English (and panel/config copy) since `master`:

   ```bash
   git diff origin/master -- custom_components/circadian_scenes/translations/en.json \
     custom_components/circadian_scenes/frontend/panel.js \
     custom_components/circadian_scenes/translations/
   ```

2. For every new or changed user-visible string: key already in `en.json` (add
   it now if a change set forgot). Translate the same key in `nb.json`,
   `nn.json`, `de.json`, `es.json`. Delete keys removed from English.
3. Same key tree and `{placeholders}` as English. No English leftovers in the
   other four files unless the string is a proper name.
4. Run `python .github/scripts/check_translations.py` (must exit 0). CI runs
   this on PRs to `master`.

Commit translations on their own:

```
Sync nb/nn/de/es translations for the release PR.
```

## 2. Changelog

Fill `## [Unreleased]` from **`git log` / `git diff origin/master`**, not from
memory. Do not keep Unreleased updated during day-to-day work on `dev`.

Match the voice of **2.0.0 / 2.1.0** in `CHANGELOG.md` (user-facing, a little
fun). Do not write a 2.2.0-style feature inventory.

- Every **user-visible** change since the last `## [X.Y.Z]` heading. Skip
  internals a user would not care about (CI Python version, widget names, API
  paths) unless the user would notice the behavior.
- `### Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed`. Drop empty subsections, or leave the three
  headers with no bullets (empty Unreleased → the workflow does not publish).
- Write what you *get*, then why it matters. Nested bullets are fine when a
  feature has parts. Occasional `!` is fine; not every line.
- Emojis: **a few, on purpose.** 🚨 on each breaking line (and a `### 🚨 Breaking
  changes` blurb on majors). ⭐ on at most one standout Added item. Do not
  decorate every bullet.
- Big releases only: a short `### Summary:` paragraph (see 2.0.0). Patches skip
  it.
- No secrets, tokens, or sandbox entity dumps.
- Do **not** insert `## [X.Y.Z] - date` and do **not** bump the version.

**Like this**

- ⭐ Modify transition progress - ie. move the transition towards or further away from the noon scene (to increase/decrease the brightness)
- Add support for extrapolating effects!
- Translations! Proper Norwegian (nynorsk) and Danish-Norwegian translations has been added alongside German
- Combine Dawn/sunrise/sunset instead of dawn/dusk and sunrise/sunset (makes more sense in real-life)
- 🚨 Renamed all entity variables, meaning the only user (me), has to reconfigure all the integration entries - wohoo!

**Not like this** (implementation inventory, no voice):

- List page: Extrapolation / Created scenes tabs (`ha-tab-group`), global settings sidebar (hide created scenes in the HA UI), row settings/delete on both lists, New FAB on both tabs

Classify (for the PR label; workflow uses the label if present, else infers):

| Bump | When |
|------|------|
| **major** | 🚨 — stored keys, entity unique ids, or service fields that **cannot** be migrated |
| **minor** | Features; `### Added` has entries |
| **patch** | Fixes only (`### Fixed` / `### Changed` without Added or 🚨) |

The sidebar/store move is a **minor** (automatic import). Future majors need a
missing migrator, not a new screen.

Commit:

```
Update Unreleased changelog for the release PR.
```

## 3. Local CI (required before opening the PR)

Do **not** open the PR until this exits 0. Matches `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
`lint` (+ translations already checked in step 1). Prefer the repo `.venv`
(Python 3.14) so tools match CI:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install once if missing: pip install pylint black isort pytest homeassistant
pylint custom_components/circadian_scenes/
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -q
node --test tests/frontend/*.test.mjs
black --check custom_components/circadian_scenes/ tests/
isort --check-only custom_components/circadian_scenes/ tests/
```

If black/isort fail: apply `black` / `isort` (no `--check`), commit the
formatting, re-run the checks. Stop on pylint, pytest, or frontend `node --test`
failures — fix and re-run; do not open a red PR and “let CI catch it.”

## 4. Open the PR

```bash
git push -u origin dev
gh label create release:patch --color "0E8A16" --description "Patch release when merged to master" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create release:minor --color "1D76DB" --description "Minor release when merged to master" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create release:major --color "B60205" --description "Major release when merged to master" 2>/dev/null || true
```

If a PR from `dev` to `master` is already open, stop after the push (do not open a second one). Otherwise:

```bash
gh pr create --base master --head dev --label "release:<patch|minor|major>" --title "Release: <one-line why>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <user-visible why this ships>

## Release
- Suggested bump: <patch|minor|major>
- Changelog is under Unreleased; the merge workflow assigns the version.

## Test plan
- [ ] Local CI green (pylint, pytest, black, isort) before open
- [ ] CI green on the PR
- [ ] Translation check (`check_translations.py`) passed locally
EOF
)"
```

Pushing `dev` is required to open the PR. Never force-push. Do not merge unless
the user asked.

`release:skip` on a PR to `master` updates the branch without publishing (docs /
workflow-only). Prefer that over an empty Unreleased only when nothing should
ship.

## Do not

- Open the PR with failing local lint/tests (translations-only is not enough).
- Leave Unreleased empty and invent notes — read the diff.
- Bump major because the UI moved if `__init__.py` still imports legacy entries.
- Commit `.storage`, `dev/config/secrets.yaml`, or `release_notes.md`.
- Run `.github/workflows` by pushing a `v*` tag (the tag-based release path is gone).
